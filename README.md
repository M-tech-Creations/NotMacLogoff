NotMacLogoff
============

An app that looks like the OSX logoff message

============
Description

This is a very simple app that runs on windows XP, and 7 (have not tried it on vista or 8 but should work) that is meant to look and perform like the logout message found in the OSX operating system.


Install

To use this program, simply place the program anywhere on your computer, then create shortcut to the program. Lastly, map a key combo (I used ctrl + shift + Q) to the shortcut by right clicking >> properties.
